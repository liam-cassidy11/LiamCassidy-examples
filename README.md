Some examples of work I have done on various projects

For encrypted storage project:

createAccount.py and login.py were used as the backend for our create account and login pages. 

main.rs is the rust code we are using to create and reconstruct shares. 

Communication.md is a markdown file I created and we used to document how we plan on implementing secure communication into our project.

331 project:

331projectPt3.py is python code I wrote with two other group members for a CSE 331 project last semester.
