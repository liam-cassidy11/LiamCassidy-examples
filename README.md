Some examples of work I have done on various projects

For encrypted storage project:
createAccount.py and login.py were used as the backend for our create account and login pages. 
main.rs is the rust code we are using to create and reconstruct shares. 
Communication.md is a markdown file I created and we used to document how we plan on implementing secure communication into our project.
BundlePageTester.html is an html and javascript page I wrote to test how our bundle page would look, we hadn't actually implemented it with our database yet so right now it just has test data.

331 project:
331projectPt3.py is python code I wrote with two other group members for a CSE 331 project last semester.
